<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>The Google AI Challenge is designed, built, and operated completely by volunteers. As the number of participants has steadily grown, so has the amount of work required to make it all happen.</p>
<p>With the move to <a href="https://github.com/aichallenge/aichallenge">fully open-source</a>, many of the contestants have been contributing code to help us keep up with the volume of feature requests and bug fixes. <!--All-in-all, several dozen people have contributed to the design, implementation, and operation of the Fall 2010 Google AI Challenge. To all the hackers who sent us patches to fix bugs, created new and interesting visualizers, set up independent game servers, translated the starter packages into new languages, and told us how to fix the webserver whenever it got crushed by traffic spikes from Reddit, we are truly grateful.--> Thank you.</p>
<p>There are a few people who have been especially generous with their time and expertise. Our special thanks goes out to these individuals.</p>
