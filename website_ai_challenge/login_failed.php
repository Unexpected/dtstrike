<h2>Login Failed</h2>
<p>Your login attempt failed. There are a couple reasons why this might be.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Did you spell your username and password correctly?</li>
  <li>Have you activated your account yet? Check your junk mail folder for the confirmation email. You can't use your account until it is activated.</li>
</ul>
