GO starter Package by Kevin Lansard
Done with goeclipse : 

Your starting point for improving this startup bot is by modifying 
src\goAndStart\MyFirstBot.go

To build properly this bot on your desktop :
Do not forget to set the GOPATH value (in env.cmd on windows and/or in eclipse)
- make.cmd, build for windows in command line
- bench.cmd is usefull only if you have a huge replay file, ask me if you need one
- test.cmd will test your bot with a few turns from the maps in the maps directory
- pprofPerlWin.cmd and pprof_win.pl are for win setups where the output of the bench are not readable (GO is built against 32bit PERL)

As i know you won't be a lot to read this... please contact me for help and strategy sharing.

if you need pointer in how to develop with GO, here are some good starting point :
